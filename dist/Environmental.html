    <h1>Environmental</h1>  
    <p4> The Environmental criterion analyzes a companyâ€™s impact on the environment, which includes corporate policies put in place to address climate change, air or water pollution, energy consumption, carbon emissions, etc. Moreover, this aspect of ESG examines the environmental risks that a company might be challenged with, as well as how the company manages those risks. Therefore, companies are encouraged to reduce their environmental impacts and are held accountable for their actions surrounding environmental issues.</p4>
