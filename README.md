WESG
====

WESG, Women in ESG, is a website aiming to promote and educate about women empowerment as well as gender equality in the workplace. More corporations are establishing ESG standards yet resources are limited. On this website, organizations connect and support each other by sharing experiences and engaging in meaningful conversations surrounding various ESG criteria related to women's rights and representation.
